curies |release| Documentation
==============================
Uniform resource identifiers (URIs) and compact URIs (CURIEs)
have become the predominant syntaxes for identifying concepts
in linked data applications. Therefore, efficient, faultless,
and idiomatic conversion between them is a crucial low-level
utility whose need is ubiquitous across many codebases.

:mod:`curies` fills this need. This Python package can be used by a variety of people:

1. **Data Scientist** - someone who consumes and modifies data to suit an analysis or application.
   For example, they might want to convert tabular data containing CURIEs into IRIs,
   translate into RDF, then query with SPARQL.
2. **Curator** - someone who creates data. For example, an ontologist may want to curate using CURIEs
   but have their toolchain 1) validate the syntax and semantics and 2) convert to IRIs for their data persistence
3. **Data Consumer** - someone who consumes data. This kind of user likely won't interact with
   :mod:`curies` directly, but will likely use tools that build on top of it. For example, someone
   using the Bioregistry resolution service uses this package's expansion utilities indirectly.
4. **Software Developer** - someone who develops tools to support data creators, data consumers, and other
   software developers. For example, a software developer might want to make their toolchain more generic
   for loading, merging, and outputting prefix maps and extended prefix maps.

For many users, expansion (CURIE to URI) and contraction (URI to CURIE) are the two most important tools.

.. code-block:: python

    import curies

    # Get a converter
    converter = curies.get_obofoundry_converter()

    >>> converter.compress("http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_1")
    'CHEBI:1'

    >>> converter.expand("CHEBI:1")
    'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_1'

See the tutorial for more pre-defined converters, information on defining custom converters,
chaining converters, and more.
