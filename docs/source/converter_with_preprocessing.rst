Converter with Preprocessing
============================

When simple expansion and contraction aren't enough, and you want to
inject global or context-specific rewrite rules, you can wrap a :class:`curies.Converter`
and preprocessing rules encoded in an instance of :class:`curies.PreprocessingRules` inside
a :class:`curies.PreprocessingConverter`.
