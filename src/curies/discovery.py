"""Discovery new entries for a Converter.

The :func:`curies.discover` functionality is intended to be used in a "data science" workflow. Its goal is to
enable a data scientist to semi-interactively explore data (e.g., coming from an ontology, SSSOM, RDF)
that doesn't come with a complete (extended) prefix map and identify common URI prefixes.

It returns the discovered URI prefixes in a :class:`curies.Converter` object with "dummy" CURIE prefixes.
This makes it possible to convert the URIs appearing in the data into CURIEs and therefore enables
their usage in places where CURIEs are expected.

However, it's suggested that after discovering URI prefixes, the data scientist more carefully
constructs a meaningful prefix map based on the discovered one. This might include some or all of the
following steps:

1. Replace dummy CURIE prefixes with meaningful ones
2. Remove spurious URI prefixes that appear but do not represent a semantic space. This happens often
   due to using ``_`` as a delimiter or having a frequency cutoff of zero (see the parameters for this function).
3. Consider chaining a comprehensive extended prefix map such as the Bioregistry
   (from :func:`curies.get_bioregistry_converter`) with onto the converter passed to this function
   so pre-existing URI prefixes are not *re-discovered*.

Finally, you should save the prefix map that you create in a persistent place (i.e., inside a JSON file) such
that it can be reused.

Algorithm
---------
The :func:`curies.discover` function implements the following algorithm that does the following for each URI:

1. For each delimiter (in the priority order they are given) check if the delimiter is present.
2. If it's present, split the URI into two parts based on rightmost appearance of the delimiter.
3. If the right part after splitting is all alphanumeric characters, save the URI prefix (with delimiter attached)
4. If a delimiter is successfully used to identify a URI prefix, don't check any of the following delimiters

After identifying putative URI prefixes, the second part of the algorithm does the following:

1. If a cutoff was provided, remove all putative URI prefixes for which there were fewer examples than the cutoff
2. Sort the URI prefixes lexicographically (i.e., with :func:`sorted`)
3. Assign a dummy CURIE prefix to each URI prefix, counting upwards from 1
4. Construct a converter from this prefix map and return it

        An iterable of URIs to search through. Will be taken as a set and

    :param delimiters:
        The character(s) that delimit a URI prefix from a local unique identifier.
        If none given, defaults to using ``/``, ``#``, and ``_``. For example:

        - ``/`` is the delimiter in ``https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37929212``, which separates
          the URI prefix ``https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/`` from the local unique identifier
          `37929212 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37929212>`_ for the article
          "New insights into osmobiosis and chemobiosis in tardigrades" in PubMed.
        - ``#`` is the delimiter in ``http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label``, which separates
          the URI prefix ``http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#`` from the local unique identifier
          `label <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>`_ for the term "label" in the RDF Schema.
          The ``#`` typically is used in a URL to denote a fragment and commonly appears in small semantic
          web vocabularies that are shown as a single HTML page.
        - ``_`` is the delimiter in ``http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0032571``, which separates
          the URI prefix ``http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_`` from the local unique identifier
          `0032571 <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0032571>`_ for the term "response to vitamin K"
          in the Gene Ontology

    :param cutoff:
        If given, will require more than ``cutoff`` unique local unique identifiers
        associated with a given URI prefix to keep it.

        Defaults to zero, which increases recall (i.e., likelihood of getting all
        possible URI prefixes) but decreases precision (i.e., more of the results
        might be false positives / spurious). If you get a lot of false positives,
        try increasing first to 1, 2, then maybe higher.
    :param metaprefix:
        The beginning part of each dummy prefix, followed by a number. The default value
        is ``ns``, so dummy prefixes are named ``ns1``, ``ns2``, and so on.
    :param converter:
        If a pre-existing converter is passed, then URIs that can be parsed using the
        pre-existing converter are not considered during discovery.

        For example, if you're an OBO person working with URIs coming from an OBO ontology,
        it makes sense to pass the converter from :func:`curies.get_obo_converter` to
        reduce false positive discoveries. More generally, a comprehensive converter
        like the Bioregistry (from :func:`curies.get_bioregistry_converter`) can massively
        reduce false positive discoveries and ultimately reduce burden on the data scientist
        using this function when needing to understand the results and carefully curate a prefix
        map based on the discoveries.
